Knight Night
A collaborative 2D endless runner game built with JavaFX, designed to showcase key object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java.
Project Description
Knight Night is an endless runner game where players navigate a perpetually scrolling environment as a knight. The objective is to survive as long as possible by avoiding obstacles and collecting life-boosting totems. The project serves as a practical application of Java programming, demonstrating core software engineering and OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and proper use of design patterns.
